                    T-DOT (Telematics-Diagnostics Onboard Trailer). Telematic unit specially designed for trailer. It is a sealed unit (IP67), equipped with diagnostics options on EBS systems and cooling systems. Among the connectivity options are GSM/GPRS, Bluetooth and CAN. It also has interfaces for diagnostics through CAN, RS-232 and K-line. It features an internal battery to prevent data loss and maintain the connection with the server when disconnecting the trailer. It also enables the configuration of analogue and/or digital inputs to monitor specific indicators of each line of business. In short, it is a device that locates, diagnoses and reports the condition of a trailer with a simple and quick installation, and with maximum guarantees.
