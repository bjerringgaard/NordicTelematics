    <h1>Fuel</h1>
    <p>
    Fuel is one of the most important matters related to the cost management. Reducing these costs represents an improvement on the company performance. These costs can be reduced by using analysis tools of a good fleet manager such as Jaltest ODF.
<br><br>
    This simple module intends to perform fuel consumption control per vehicle and driver, to reduce the administrative charge for entering the fueling tickets of each vehicle in the system since this task will be carried out by the driver through his/her application.
<br><br>
    Finally, the fleet manager, through the reports, will be able to compare consumption with the price per kilometer according to the fueling operations and, in short, he/she will be able to analyze how to reduce fuel costs.
