    <h1>FLEET MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS</h1>
    <p>
    True to our philosophy of making the best use of our clients’ data, with a minimum effort on their part, 
    ODF offers on its main screen a complete catalogue with indicators to detect trends and have a global vision of the fleet state. 
    This way, our clients have access to vital information to detect trend changes in aspects as important as the fuel consumption, driving styles, 
    waiting times… among many others. All of this through a set of diagrams and simple tables that will allow the client to make decisions based on 
    the analysis of large amounts of data that are gathered day by day.
