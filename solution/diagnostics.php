    <h1>Diagnoser</h1>
    <p>
    Jaltest Optimal Driving Fleet is the first solution in the market that allows to perform remote multibrand diagnosis.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Vehicle state</b>
    <br>
    At a glance, we can verify the diagnosis state of all vehicles belonging to our fleet, identifying the vehicles where a diagnosis error has been found. In case a diagnosis error is found, the appropriate actions can be carried out depending on its severity.
    <br>
    The diagnosis procedures are launched automatically when the driver turns on the ignition key. In addition, the fleet manager can program a time interval to send a diagnosis request to the vehicle. The information gathered during these procedures is used to check the vechicle state, thus guaranteeing that, at each start-up, the vehicle has no errors and is ready to tackle a working day in optimal conditions.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Advanced diagnosis </b>
    <br>
    Through this submenu, any expert user can launch a diagnosis procedure for the reading of error codes, values measurements and ECU data in real time in order to know the state of one or multiple systems in each vehicle.
