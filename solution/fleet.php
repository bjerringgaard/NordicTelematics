    This option allows the display of a list with the vehicles and drivers that make up the fleet. The following information is available for the user of the ODF Jaltest portal: Vehicle data, Drivers, Technical data, Installed telematic modules, Other data of interest, electronic systems mounted in the vehicle inside the Jaltest selection, diagnosis planner, and maintenances list.
  <br><br>
    At this point it is important to point out the possibility to configure inputs to the telematic devices to monitor the reading of sensors related to the specific fleet bussiness, such as: tire pressure sensor, door opening sensor, temperature sensor, etc.
  <br><br>
    Having this point well organized will mean a good management and optimization of our fleet.
