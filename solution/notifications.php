    <h1>NOTIFICATIONS TO THE WORKSHOP</h1>
    <p>
    Together with the remote diagnosis, this is one of the Jaltest ODF modules that make a difference. This way, we cann connect with the fleet from the workshop (be it our workshop or other workshop), so the maintenances management and the repair of failures is as efficient as possible. Through this menu, the workshop has access to the vehicle state and even to the components that may be damaged, which allows to acquire the vehicle parts that have to be replaced before it arrives to the workshop.

    This module helps to reduce the repair times and, therefore, to improve the productivity of the fleet.
