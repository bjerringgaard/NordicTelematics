    <h1>Order management</h1>
    <p>
      Tracking of wares by date, vehicle and driver. Through this menu, the application user has a complete order traceability; the drivers themselves inform about the state of the order or any other important note by using the application installed in their phones. This way, a very useful tool to improve the order management is achieved, with the corresponding impact on the service quality of the fleet itself. The client, in turn, can see their order’s tracking during the different states (order pending to load, loaded order, order in transit, order at its destination, delivered order or cancelled order).
